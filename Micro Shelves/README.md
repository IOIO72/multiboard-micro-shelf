## Description

This is a collection of micro shelves in different sizes for [Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io/) Pegboard or [Multipoint](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints).

Included shelves:

* Lego Figure
* [Lemmings](https://makerworld.com/de/models/532452) Figure
* _You like other measurements? See section Contribution for more information_


## Contribution

There are two ways for contribution:

1. Request other micro shelves dimensions via GitHub and [open an issue](https://github.com/IOIO72/multiboard-micro-shelf/issues/new/choose).
2. Generate the micro shelves yourself via [Multiboard Micro Shelf For Multipoint Or Pegboard](https://github.com/IOIO72/multiboard-micro-shelf).

The reason why I do not publish a customizer on MakerWorld is the license of the required file *Lite Multipoint Rail - Negative.stl* and *Pegboard Click.stl*, which you have to download yourself.
